# Prettier ignore patterns
# Lines here follow .gitignore-style globbing.
# Keep this minimal: only exclude generated artifacts or large vendor trees.

# Node & build outputs
node_modules
dist
coverage
coverage-frontend
coverage-reports

# Tauri build artifacts
src-tauri/target
src-tauri/gen

# Bundled release artifacts (downloaded in CI release job)
bundles/

# OS / editor junk (usually already in .gitignore, harmless to duplicate)
.DS_Store

# Generated lock files are not formatted by Prettier anyway
package-lock.json

# Keep JSON/TOML config files included for formatting:
# (Do NOT ignore: tsconfig.json, vite.config.ts, tauri.conf.json, Cargo.toml, deny.toml)

# If future large auto-generated code appears, append patterns below with justification comments.
