## ❓ FAQ

**Q: How do I set a wallpaper?**
**A:** Click any wallpaper card to instantly set it as your desktop. On macOS, it applies to all monitors automatically.

**Q: Does the app keep running after closing the window?**
**A:** Yes, closing the window minimizes it to the system tray. Click the tray icon to reopen, right-click to quit.

**Q: Where are my wallpapers saved?**
**A:** By default in a "Bing Wallpaper Now" folder under your system pictures directory. You can change this in settings.

**Q: How much storage does it use?**
**A:** Each UHD wallpaper is roughly 1–3MB. Keeping 8 uses about 8–24MB. The app auto-cleans older cache.

**Q: Can I use it offline?**
**A:** Yes, previously downloaded wallpapers can be set anytime without internet.

**Q: Why does a "market mismatch" warning appear?**
**A:** Bing may ignore your selected market in some regions and return wallpapers from another. The app adapts automatically — no action needed.
