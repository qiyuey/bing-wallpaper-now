### Set Wallpaper

- **Click any wallpaper card** to immediately set it as your desktop wallpaper
- The wallpaper is applied instantly
- On macOS, it applies to all connected displays

### System Tray

The app runs in your system tray for quick access:

- **Left click** - Show/hide main window
- **Right click** - Menu (show window, quit)
- **Close window** - Minimize to tray (app keeps running)

### Settings

Click the "Settings" (star icon) to customize:

> actual returned market for indexing, and show a warning in Settings.

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: How often are wallpapers updated?**  
**A:** Bing releases new wallpapers daily. Enable "Auto Update" to fetch the latest automatically.

**Q: Where are my wallpapers saved?**  
**A:** By default, they're in a "Bing Wallpaper Now" folder in your system
pictures directory, but you can change this in settings.

**Q: Can I use it offline?**  
**A:** Yes! Previously downloaded wallpapers are always available and can still be set offline.

**Q: How much storage does it use?**  
**A:** Each UHD wallpaper is roughly 1–3MB. Keeping 8 uses 8–24MB.

**Q: Can wallpapers be kept forever?**  
**A:** The app automatically cleans older cached wallpapers over time to keep
storage usage predictable. A "favorites/never delete" option is not available yet.

**Q: Why does the app show a market mismatch warning?**  
**A:** This means Bing returned wallpapers for a different market than the one
you selected. It usually happens due to regional restrictions. The app keeps
working and uses the actual returned market to avoid empty lists.
